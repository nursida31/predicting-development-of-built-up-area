We use Google Earth Engine to perform image processing and obtain NDVI and NDBI information. Image analysis was carried out on GEE by filtering and masking with 20% cloud cover on Landsat 8 and 9 images. Filtering operations were carried out every year on the best image collection for five years of data (2018 - 2022).
